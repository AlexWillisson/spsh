splash shell (spsh) is a program designed to make it simple to input a
set of nodes, and run bulk operations on them based on GUI
interactions.

A basic example, which is the first part of the implementation being
worked on, is a file organizer. A list of files will be passed in
through the command line and will appear as nodes. Those nodes will be
able to be moved, grouped, renamed, etc. Unlike traditional file
managers, spsh will display an arbitrary list of files instead of a
single directory.
